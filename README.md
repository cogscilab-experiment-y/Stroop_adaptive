# Stroop_adaptive

This task was a modified version of the Stroop and used an adaptive procedure to estimate the
participantâ€™s threshold. Eighteen blocks of 18 trials each (total 324 trials) were administered. Each trial
had a response deadline that limited how long the participant had to respond before they heard a loud
beep and forfeited the opportunity to respond on that trial. This response deadline either decreased
(less time to respond) if the participant was accurate on at least 15 trials within each block or increased
(more time to respond) if their accuracy rate was below that. The first block had a response deadline of
1,230 ms. For the first six blocks, the response deadline either decreased by 90 ms or increased by 270
ms for the next block, again depending on whether the participant was accurate on at least 15 of the 18
trials. For subsequent blocks, the response deadline either decreased by 30 ms or increased by 90 ms.
The stimuli remained on the screen until the response deadline. Each block had 12 congruent and six
incongruent trials in random order with a randomized 400 ms to 700 ms ISI. The response deadline was
the same for incongruent and congruent trials. Further, congruent and incongruent trials were treated
equally in determining whether or not the deadline increased or decreased for the next block (i.e.,
participants needed to be correct and respond before the deadline on at least 15 of 18 total trials for the
response deadline to decrease, independent of whether these trials were incongruent or congruent).
The dependent variable was the response deadline after the final block (i.e., what the deadline would
have been on a hypothetical 19th block). If the response deadline were to be set below 150 ms, it was
set to exactly 150 ms instead.
